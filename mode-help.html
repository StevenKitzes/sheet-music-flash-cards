      <h4>Guess Mode</h4>
      <p>In Guess Mode, <strong>you will be shown</strong> a note.  You'll have some time to think and determine what that note is.  After a few seconds, you will be shown the name of the note so you can see if you were right.  Then a new note will be shown.  Repeat!  You can change the duration of each flash card at the bottom of the screen if you feel you're waiting too long or not long enough.</p>
      <h4>Find Mode</h4>
      <p>In Find Mode, <strong>you will be shown the name</strong> of a note.  You'll have some time to <strong>click</strong> on the correct placement of that note.  You'll get some feedback telling you if your guess was right or wrong.  If you're wrong, you'll be shown where the correct answer was.  If you run out of time, you'll be shown where the correct answer was.</p>
