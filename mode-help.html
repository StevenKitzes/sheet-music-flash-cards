      <h4>Guess Mode</h4>
      <p>In Guess Mode, <strong>you will be shown a note</strong>.  All you have to do is determine what that note is.  After a few seconds, you'll see the name of the note so you can check if you were right.  Then a new note will be shown.  You can change the duration of each flash card at the bottom of the screen.</p>
      <h4>Find Mode</h4>
      <p>In Find Mode, <strong>you will be shown the full name</strong> of a note (including octave).  You'll have some time to <strong>pick</strong> on the correct location of that note on the staff/ledger lines.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you match the full note with octave, the screen will flash green!</li>
        <li>If you match the note but not the octave, the screen will flash green, and the octave number will update to clarify which octave you picked.</li>
        <li>If you pick the wrong note, the screen will flash red.  You can still guess again until you're right or time runs out!</li>
        <li>If you run out of time, the screen will flash red, and you'll be shown all locations of the note you're looking for.</li>
      </ul>
